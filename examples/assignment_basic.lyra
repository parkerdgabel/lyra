(* Basic Assignment Examples *)
(* Demonstrates immediate assignment (=) vs delayed assignment (:=) *)

(* Immediate assignment - evaluates right side now *)
x = 42
y = x + 8
z = y * 2

(* Show the values *)
x
y  
z

(* Reassignment *)
x = 100
x

(* The previously assigned y and z do not change when x changes *)
(* because they were evaluated when assigned *)
y
z
