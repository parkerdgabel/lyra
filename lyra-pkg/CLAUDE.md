# Lyra Package Manager (lyra-pkg)

## Purpose

**Lyra-pkg** is the official package manager for the Lyra programming language, providing:
- Package creation and initialization
- Dependency management and resolution
- Build system integration
- Distribution and registry management

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Package Creation**: Initialize new Lyra packages with proper structure
- **Dependency Resolution**: Resolve and manage package dependencies
- **Build Integration**: Interface with Lyra compiler for package building
- **Registry Interface**: Communicate with package registries

### Package Structure
```
lyra-package/
├── Package.toml          # Package manifest
├── src/
│   ├── lib.lyra         # Main library file
│   └── ...              # Additional source files
├── tests/               # Package tests
├── examples/            # Usage examples
└── docs/               # Package documentation
```

## Development Guidelines

### TDD Requirements
- **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**: All package management features must be test-driven
- **Integration Tests**: Test full package lifecycle (create → build → test → publish)
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (resolver, validator, etc.)

### Code Organization
- Keep CLI interface simple and intuitive
- Separate core logic from CLI presentation
- Use proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Follow Rust best practices for CLI tools

### Commands Structure
```rust
// Command structure
lyra-pkg init <name>              // Create new package
lyra-pkg check                    // Validate package
lyra-pkg build                    // Build package
lyra-pkg test                     // Run package tests
lyra-pkg publish                  // Publish to registry
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
1. **CLI Tests**: Test command-line interface behavior
2. **Integration Tests**: Test package operations end-to-end
3. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and modules
4. **Filesystem Tests**: Test package structure creation and validation

### Test Requirements
- All commands must have comprehensive tests
- Error cases must be thoroughly tested
- Cross-platform compatibility must be verified
- Performance tests for large dependency graphs

## Integration with Main Lyra

### Compiler Integration
- Interface with main Lyra compiler for building packages
- Leverage existing lexer/parser/compiler infrastructure
- Reuse error handling and reporting systems

### Module System Integration
- Work with Lyra's module system for dependency resolution
- Support import/export mechanisms
- Handle versioning and compatibility

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
- **Package Errors**: Invalid package structure, missing files
- **Dependency Errors**: Unresolved dependencies, version conflicts
- **Build Errors**: Compilation failures, missing resources
- **Registry Errors**: Network issues, authentication failures

### Error Reporting
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Include context and suggestions for fixing issues
- Use structured error types for programmatic handling

## Security Considerations

### Package Validation
- Validate package manifests before processing
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Verify package signatures when available

### Dependency Security
- Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Support security advisory integration
- Provide audit command for security review

## Performance Requirements

### Build Performance
- Incremental compilation support
- Parallel dependency resolution
- Efficient caching of build artifacts

### Memory Usage
- Streaming operations for large packages
- Lazy loading of package metadata
- Efficient dependency graph representation

## Future Considerations

### Registry Features
- Support for multiple registries
- Private registry support
- Authentication and authorization

### Advanced Features
- Workspace support for multi-package projects
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Integration with CI/CD systems
